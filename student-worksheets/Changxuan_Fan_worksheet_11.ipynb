    "In this section we will fetch news articles from 3 different categories. We will perform Tfidf vectorization on the corpus of documents and use SVD to represent our corpus in the feature space of topics that we've uncovered from SVD. We will attempt to cluster the documents into 3 clusters as we vary the number of singular vectors we use to represent the corpus, and compare the output to the clustering created by the news article categories. Do we end up with a better clustering the more singular vectors we use?\n"

Rather than simply indicating which words are present, word embeddings represent each word by \"embedding\" it in a low-dimensional vector space which may carry more information about the semantic meaning of the word. (for example in this space, the words \"King\" and \"Queen\" would be close).\n",
